This is the document explaining the piecewise normalization methods we explored in effort to alleviate the
range shift issue present in the EMG.

A piecewise z-score normalization was proposed over the z-score normalization on the entire dataset. The hope
was for the model to not get confused with sleeps of different EMG ampltitude.

A window size of 64 seconds is chosen for the experiment logged, it is chosen to be in sync with the 64 seconds
window in the Seq_len the seq transformer model uses.

The code for the normalization part is below:

    n_secondsTemp,_ = emg.shape
    window_size = 64

    if n_secondsTemp % window_size != 0:
        excess = n_secondsTemp % window_size
        emg = emg[:-excess]
        eeg = eeg[:-excess]
        sleep_scores = sleep_scores[:-excess]

    # windowed emg z-score normalization

    n_windows = n_secondsTemp // window_size
    print("emg shape:",emg.shape)
    emg_standardized = []
    for i in range(n_windows):
        window = emg[i * window_size : (i + 1) * window_size, :]
        mean = np.mean(window)
        std = np.std(window) + 1e-8  # Add epsilon to prevent division by zero
        normalized_window = (window - mean) / std
        emg_standardized.append(normalized_window)
    emg_standardized = np.concatenate(emg_standardized, axis=0)  # Shape: (n_secondsTemp, 512)

The preliminary result shows slight improvement in sleep prediction for various different ranges of EMG
ampltitudes but there exists a problem with REM over-prediction.

I believe more training data is needed in order to improve performance on those specific problem datasets.

The hope is to add NE as a third input of the model and potentially try this method again to test for results.
